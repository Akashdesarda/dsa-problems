    "# Container With Most Water\n",
    "\n",
    "- `Problem`: You are given an integer array height of length n. There are n vertical lines drawn such that the two endpoints of the ith line are (i, 0) and (i, height[i]). Find two lines that together with the x-axis form a container, such that the container contains the most water. Return the maximum amount of water a container can store.\n",

    "Output: 49\n",
    "Explanation: The above vertical lines are represented by array [1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7]. In this case, the max area of water (blue section) the container can contain is 49.\n",

    "- Maintain a variable `max_area` to store the maximum area obtained till now. \n",
